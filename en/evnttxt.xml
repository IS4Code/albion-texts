    <line id="18">"The sword masters speak of combat as the prayer of the Kenget. Naturally, that's not an entirely false statement, for combat is directed outwards and dedicated to our god, the great Kamulos. But even more, combat serves to perfect one's spirit. Therefore, combat is also meditation - aimed inwards, a school for the spirit. This is particularly true for the Oqulo, whose only weapon is the spirit. They believe this more strongly than the Kledo, who must defend against their deficient fear with weapons." {WORDweapons}{WORDfear}{WORDKledo}{WORDOqulo}</line>

    <line id="20">"Magic, as you call it, is nothing other than the highest emanation of the human spirit. The greatest power also arises from the greatest fear through the greatest spirit. This is how magic creates things from nothing. But, these things are nothing other than altered force. Magic, therefore, is nothing other than the art of converting one's own spiritual force into matter. It is really simple for those who have learned it."{WORDspirit}</line>

His weapon is the spirit, the pure overcoming of his fear - the separation of his thoughts from his body. His means is his concentration. The status of Oqulo is reached via two stages. First, you can control simple things, use self-hypnosis, and be completely insensitive to pain. Then, the novice learns combat magic, the highest stage of which is defensive magic. When he has conquered all of this, he becomes a priest. Only as a priest is one ordained into the secrets of conjuring demons and equipping weapons with magic capabilities." {WORDdemons}{WORDmagic}{WRNR----}</line>
    <line id="24">"Naturally, that depends on whether you are trained as Kledo or Oqulo." {WORDKledo}{WORDOqulo}</line>
    <line id="25">"Rituals? We have no rituals! We have ceremonies. I know that many in the order speak of rituals, supposedly even some of the high priests. They overlook the fact that we honor a god who lives. And so that lives which must be a dead ritual for others who worship a dead god. Kamulos lives! And if one of us dies for him, it is not a ritual. He who is sacrificed takes a place at Kamulos' table, and there is no more honorable place than that which is set on New Years' day." {WORDdeath}{WORDNew year's eve}</line>
    <line id="26">"The spirit controls the flesh. The flesh forces a person to cowardice. The flesh urges the man to the woman. The spirit is the pride of the soul.

    <line id="27">"Yes, I know, there's a lot of talk about that. But, ultimately, it is our business. If those who call themselves the Enlightened Ones were really so enlightened, then they would understand and support this arrangement. Because it makes a big difference to us whether the so-called victims, about whom so much is said, are killed honorably by one of us or killed like a mad dog by low murderers. When we accept these assignments, we give the destined victims an opportunity to die in honor. They will thank us when they are guests at Kamulos' table." {WORDdeath}{WORDKamulos}{WORDhonor}</line>

Then, the Cuain falls into a day-long sleep from which he awakes only when he is rubbed with the blood of one who was slain honorably." </line>

Therefore, they do everything that has to do in any way with the household. Their children, however, may rise to become a Kenget if they show talent.

    <line id="32">"Well! We rise pretty early and we meditate for an hour before breakfast. Then we continue meditating and there are two hours of prayer exercises before noon. In the afternoon, there is ceremony training and two more hours of prayer. In the evening, there is meditation until sunset. There's a fair amount of meditation, especially in the summer. But I think it helps against fear." {WORDprayer}{WORDfear}</line>

    <line id="36">"Actually everyone who is not a Kenget is impure. However, since there may be a Kenget hiding unknowingly within every man, a man may become pure by his honorable death. For a man it is hard to figure out who is pure, since purity is expressed by deep understanding of the eternal laws of Kamulos at the time of death. But Kamulos knows, and he gathers the pure dead around his table."</line>

    <line id="41">"For a Kenget it is the highest honor to leave his life on the occasion of the New Year. It is the day before the war god sleeps, and with him the Cuain falls into the deepest trance. The Cuain cannot be awakened until he is washed with the blood of a Kenget who has honorably fallen and who had at least priest status. For this purpose, at the winter solstice, the oldest priest may challenge one of the high priests to a duel to the death. Then, it is the blood of the one fallen in the highest conceivable honor which brings back the war god in the new year. Fortunate are those who die this way." {WORDNew year's eve}{WORDfive high priests}</line>
    <line id="42">"Unfortunately, history has shown that this is the greatest danger for the Kenget. I have seen so many hopeful Oqulo fade away because at a weak moment they fell prey to the pride of the flesh, and forgot the pride of the soul.

When he learned about the rejection, he went completely out of control. He swore he would achieve immortality in spite of everything.

A clan arises over the course of many years through relationships, the loyalty of several families, or sometimes even because of economic reasons.

    <line id="11">"The council of Jirinaar is the government of all Nakiridaani. It meets in the council building in the middle of the city. Every five years, the Sebai of the Nakiridaani clans sit in the council and choose the Sebainah, the chief of the council, from among them. The Sebainah governs our people, but he needs the council's agreement in important matters. The council forms the so-called council circles, that is, groups of people who are directed by at least one council member to take care of specific tasks. For example, the Sebai selection, conflicts, or family matters such as divorces."{WORDSebai}{WORDSebainah}{WORDNakiridaani}{WORDJirinaar}{WORDclan}</line>
    <line id="12">"Now, naturally, there are voices of criticism, primarily from the clanless families or clans whose members have not received the honor of the Sebai ritual. They have almost no influence on the government and consider this to be a great injustice."</line>
    <line id="13">"The Sebainah, as the chief of the council, has great influence. In times of crisis, the council may even grant the Sebainah special powers, and the Sebainah becomes lord over life and death on Nakiridaani during that time.

Further, the ritual cannot be carried out without the newborn's mother's consent.

For example, if someone has distinguished himself by particular courage or self-sacrifice. If he or she dies, a brother or sister may be made Sebai in honor of this person. ^ ^ Quite often, it also happens that someone who has reached high rank in the Stiriik is chosen.

It's ironic that you knew nothing about the presence of other humans here until you saw this frightful murder. ^ Now, can I possibly provide you with any information?"{BLOK010}"From your title, I take it that you have gone through the Sebai ritual 20 times.

    <line id="4">"That is true. My interest in this world and its history keeps me from getting weary of life, as so often happens with Sebai. And it is my knowledge which keeps causing the council to make me a candidate."{WORDSebai}</line>
    <line id="5">"The time when humans first appeared is hidden in the darkness of history even for me. However, unlike many others, I do not believe they originally came from this world: You have confirmed my theory. ^ However, relations between humans and Iskai have not always been peaceful, especially during the early centuries after humans arrived. There were repeated wars with the Iskai. Apparently, these early humans considered it normal to take territory by force. However, as time went on, the conflicts became less frequent...the last altercation was over 156 years ago. However, our race is inclined to forget quickly, while humans, I believe, have changed their ways somewhat over the centuries. They have developed cultures that differ more than is normal for the Iskai. As far as I know, Iskai and humans live fairly peacefully together now."{WORDcultures}</line>
    <line id="6">"A difficult question. A similar event happened more than 240 years ago. It involved a powerful Iskai merchant who became very involved with human affairs. Akiir had no relations with human beings. Therefore, only an Iskai could have given the orders. But why anyone could have had a reason for such horrible behavior is a complete riddle to me."</line>

    <line id="10">"Kenget Kamulos can be loosely translated as "The Footsoldiers of Kamulos," Kamulos being the name of their supreme deity. As far as I know, they are divided into two groups: the warriors and the mages, who are supposedly very powerful when it comes to battle and destruction. Exactly where they are found is one of their secrets. Apparently, they are convinced that they are the only ones who maintain their forefathers' true warrior ideals."</line>
    <line id="11">"Beloveno is a harbor city in the south of the great continent far northeast of here. We call this land Trenkiriidan, and the humans call it Maini. Both humans and Iskai live there. Beloveno itself is inhabited mostly by humans, but also some Iskai. The city lives primarily from trading. If I remember correctly, Drirr's mother is from Beloveno. He can certainly tell you something about this city."</line>
    <line id="12">"I don't know a lot about these people. They live in a fortified city which controls a straight on an important sea route. For hundreds of years they have lived from the tolls they raise there. I hear they have become decadent."</line>
    <line id="13">"In the dry land far to the east live some humans devoted to producing valuable metals. They know rituals for placating the Goddess, who is offended by this digging for metals. They produce weapons, many different crafted implements, and jewelry, and export these all over the world. We also get many metals from them. A long time ago, their monopoly was so strong that regular wars broke out among the humans. Even today there are no great smiths among the humans who are not under the Umajos' influence. It is said that they set the assassins of the Kenget Kamulos against their competitors, but that is only a rumor."</line>
    <line id="14">"Frill, are you sure that digging for raw materials raises the Goddess' wrath?'</line>
    <line id="15">"You know our language well enough that I can hear the doubt in your voice, Rainiir. This is not a question of belief, my friend. We have tried many times to get valuable metals from the earth. It has always caused catastrophes, earthquakes, or appearances of horrible beings. These are not rumors, but things I have actually experienced. No, be assured that I can tell superstition from reality very well."</line>

It's just a shame that all of this is converted into a factory which takes raw materials from other worlds and to destroy these worlds in the process - even if it is just a desert world such as our destination, which DDT so meaningfully christened 'Nugget'."{WORDDDT}{WORDNugget}{WORDcomplex}</line>
    <line id="2">"Doimlr-Daithasu-Thompson. I know your company better than you believe, Driscoll. My mother worked there and I spent part of my childhood and youth within the company culture. It's the second largest multinational corporation on Earth. It has more turnover than the gross national product of most countries. DDT arose from a merger of two European corporations and one Japanese company. The corporation is one of the strongest of the large multinationals. It looks like your job is secure, Driscoll."{WORDHQ}</line>
    <line id="3">"The newest generation of intelligent computers. DDT would never have been able to achieve this AI system if it weren't a leader in this type of technology.

The resistance to communicate with an artificial consciousness is greatly lowered when it actually looks like a human."{WORDToronto}</line>
    <line id="4">"The name for our destination planet crudely means what DDT sees in it - a profitable warehouse of raw materials, and nothing more. Haven't you seen the probe data? Let me summarize them briefly: ^ ^ The data shows a small desert planet with a gravity level of 0.8 G due to its heavy core. There is oxygen in the atmosphere, but breathing the open air is probably not possible without assistance. The world's sun is similar to the size of ours, but it radiates a color spectrum shifted somewhat to the red. The planet has no axial tilt, so there are no significant seasonal variations in temperature. I think we can count on daily temperatures of around 50 degrees Celsius and nighttime temperatures around the freezing point. ^ Oddly enough a solar revolution lasts almost as long as an earth year.

    <line id="6">"Don't remind me! In my opinion, along with the careless behavior on Gaia, Joshi's case is the biggest interstellar space travel scandal. You know, at that time, one of DDT's competitors almost completely destroyed a life-filled planet. And you know what else? If it hadn't come out that a living world was ruined and an entire planet exterminated, there would probably still be no control over the matter. ^ ^ If I remember the multi- nationals' comments, they said he planet had poisonous substances in its atmosphere which could not support human life. ^ ^ As if the native flora and fauna didn't represent life! Unbelievably, they also commented about the end of the Grik'tra. They called them lop-ears and said that they were subject to the earth virus because they were decadent and were at the end of their developmental history. It's - excuse me, I get enraged when I talk about this. Ultimately, this incident is the reason I am on the ship. Since Joshi, no private spacecraft can go to an unexplored system without a government official." {WORDgovernment}{WORDFloppy ears}{WORDHoika}</line>

    <line id="8">"Gaia is an example of the fact that mankind obviously did not learn from its errors. In the euphoria of the invention, or rather, the discovery of over-c, Gaia just had the misfortune of being a planet capable of supporting human life in the first star system mankind explored. ^ ^ The discovery of native intelligent inhabitants, the Hoika, triggered greater excitement than the discovery of the over-c. Of course, this did not prevent the settlers from treating the Hoika the same way various nations were treated during the colonial times on earth.

    <line id="17">"Haven't you seen the probe data? Let me summarize them briefly: ^ ^ The data shows a small desert planet with a gravity level of 0.8 G due to its heavy core. There is oxygen in the atmosphere, but breathing the open air is probably not possible without assistance. The world's sun is similar to the size of ours, but it radiates a color spectrum shifted somewhat to the red. The planet has no axial tilt, so there are no significant seasonal variations in temperature. I think we can count on daily temperatures of around 50 degrees Celsius and nighttime temperatures around the freezing point. ^ Oddly enough a solar revolution lasts almost as long as an earth year. I think that all that is known about our destination. We will know more after our flight."{WORDflight}</line>

    <line id="1">"To be honest, the Toronto fills me with a mixture of respect and skepticism. The physicist in me is amazed by this fantastic technical achievement. It's just a shame that all of this is converted into a factory which takes raw materials from other worlds and to destroy these worlds in the process - even if it is just a desert world such as our destination, which DDT so meaningfully christened 'Nugget'."</line>
    <line id="2">"Doimlr-Daithasu-Thompson. I know your company better than you believe, Driscoll. My mother worked there and I spent part of my childhood and youth within the company culture. It's the second largest multinational corporation on Earth. It has more turnover than the gross national product of most countries. DDT arose from a merger of two European corporations and one Japanese company. The corporation is one of the strongest of the large multinationals. DDT's losses caused by the false data on this new planet will be huge."</line>
    <line id="3">"The newest generation of intelligent computers. DDT would never have been able to achieve this AI system if it weren't a leader in this type of technology. Even still, Ned accounted for almost 25 percent of the Toronto's total developmental costs. The system contains custom processors for the consciousness algorithms. I've talked with Ned several times and it always made my spine shudder. Ned is actually an intelligent entity."</line>
    <line id="4">"Well, the name probably can't be maintained any longer - the planet has already proven itself to be a major surprise. I'd like to know what was wrong with the probe. Well, at any rate, some of the data was correct. The length of the day amounts to approximately 24 hours, the warm color of the sunlight and the absence of seasons because there is no axial tilt of the planet, are all as expected."</line>
    <line id="5">"Individual transportation seems to be primarily limited to walking here."</line>
    <line id="6">"Don't remind me! In my opinion, along with the careless behavior on Gaia, Joshi's case is the biggest interstellar space travel scandal. You know, at that time, one of DDT's competitors almost completely destroyed a life-filled planet. And you know what else? If it hadn't come out that a living world was ruined and an entire planet exterminated, there would probably still be no control over the matter. ^ ^ If I remember the multi- nationals' comments, they said he planet had poisonous substances in its atmosphere which could not support human life. ^ ^ As if the native flora and fauna didn't represent life! Unbelievably, they also commented about the end of the Grik'tra. They called them lop-ears and said that they were subject to the earth virus because they were decadent and were at the end of their developmental history. It's - excuse me, I get enraged when I talk about this. Ultimately, this incident is the reason I am on the ship. Since Joshi, no private spacecraft can go to an unexplored system without a government official."</line>

I'm happy you're visiting Beloveno, and I wish you a pleasant stay. Beloveno is a very large city, and if you are looking for opportunities to purchase things, then you are in the right place. There is a weapons and an armor dealer, a food merchant, and a mixed goods shop. We have a healer, her name is Ramina, and there is a nice tavern called 'The Open Tap'. You can also spend the night there. And naturally you should see the large harbor south of the city. If you have any questions or problems, feel free to come to me. Naturally, I am quite busy sometimes, but I can always find time for a little chat. There are also several interesting things in the area. First, there is the great mountain range which divides the continent into a north side and a south side. There is a little village by the name of Kounos on this mountain range. On the north side there is a small Iskai village called Srimalinar. Near there is a holy shrine, but there have been rumors recently that horrible creatures have been seen there. Now then, I wish you all the best for your journey. And come by again!" {WORDBeloveno}{WORDquestions}{WORDrumors}{WORDtown hall}</line>

Now, Gard and Riko are somewhat inflexible sometimes. But still, that is a strong reproach by Perron, who sometimes acts too hastily. ^ ^ However, since Perron won't leave it alone, we've all gotten together and discussed the matter. That didn't make the mood around here any better. Gard and Riko are stubborn and maintain that they cannot and do not want to cooperate with Perron any longer. They don't respect him, but he really is an honest man and I'm not too sure about Gard and Riko. In any case, I'd rather be on Perron's side.

In any case, you can't really blame the Iskai for the way they are reacting. They, too, are sending warriors to the shrine and you can certainly imagine what is going on there. But it is clear that their taboo, pride, and religion are being disrespected and violated. Since you are a very mixed group, you may not be able to be served in some shops.

    <line id="1">"Welcome to the Diamond Polishers' guild." {WORDDiamond Polisher}</line>
    <line id="2">"Welcome, friends. I am glad that you dropped by again. The diamond polishers are always fond of visitors." {WORDDiamond Polisher}</line>
    <line id="3">"Our guild has a long tradition. All of our knowledge and the experience of many years are reproduced in our masterpieces, which are displayed in the large case. ^ ^ If you are looking for an expert in precious stones you can find him here. There are display rooms, workshops and living quarters. As far as precious stones are concerned, I will gladly give you advice." {WORDgems}{WORDexperience}</line>
    <line id="4">"What are you most interested in? How we polish the stones, or are you more interested in the members of our guild? Would you like to know something about collectors or about our prices?" {WORDpolish}{WORDprices}{WORDmembers}{WORDcollectors}</line>
    <line id="5">"First, the miners send us rough stones which are secondary products of the mined ores. These stones are sorted according to size, type, and purpose, and then they're finished. Some stones are cut into smaller stones if, for example, they have flaws. We then set the stones into chains, rings and other jewelry. Other stones are improved through polishing and are immediately sold in their original form. ^ ^ You can see many examples of these preparations in our display case. If you would like to buy stones or other items, then please see Mykonou. He is usually in the display room. He is an experienced polisher and has been here for a long time. I'm sure you will recognize him." {WORDexhibition}{WORDMykonou}</line>
    <line id="6">"You'll find displays to the left and right of the entrance. Feel free to look at everything there. If you'd like to buy something, see Mykonou." {WORDMykonou}</line>
    <line id="7">"Mykonou is the oldest diamond polisher in our guild. He does not polish anymore, but can give you excellent advice and is very familiar with all precious stones. ^ ^ You usually find him in the display area where he takes care of the stones and jewelry. He is always the one to see when you want to buy something. ^ ^ Oh, yes. He is somewhat reserved, but don't let that scare you off. Many people have feel that he has only money on his mind, but that isn't entirely so."</line>
    <line id="8">"Since we produce things that one doesn't actually need to live, we can demand a bit more money. That is why only rich people buy from us. But we are not really rich; it takes a long time to polish a stone and the prices the miners charge for the rough stones are quite high. And people do not buy precious stones and jewels like they do food."{WORDMiners}</line>
    <line id="9">"Maybe you've already heard that from someone else. Since the miners are the only ones who can get the rough stones and ores out of the earth, we are dependent on them. We really don't know what to do about this: Edjirr, an Equipment Maker, is supposedly trying to mine ore himself. Please let this information stay between us. I don't believe that he has had much success since the miners are the only ones who can perform the ritual to placate Mother Earth. All the old proverbs and customs say that anyone who does not do so will no longer lead a happy life. Even though many things change in our world and the Equipment Makers are open to progress, the old traditions should not be forgotten. At least, that is my opinion." {WORDritual}</line>
    <line id="10">"Just talk to the people. Except for Mykonou, all of them are very talkative. We don't have anything against you going into our rooms. But please, don't disturb us during our polishing. ^ ^ Naturally, not all of the people are present. But you can always take a look." </line>
    <line id="11">"That's a subject in and of itself. I know of only three collectors who live here in the city. They are all pretty fanatical and weird, and dreamers as well. They live almost exclusively for their collections. You see, precious stones can have magic effects even if they aren't magic. ^ ^ When I find out how valuable a precious stone is, I no longer wonder what sacrifices the collectors made to get it. Naturally, you will always find the greatest collection right here in our display. Perhaps you know Ohl. He's a typical example of someone who can only think about precious stones." {WORDmagic gems}{WORDexhibition}</line>
    <line id="12">"Magical precious stones are an absolute rarity. I only know of very, very few which have any significant effect. The most famous magical stone is probably the 'Stone of a Thousand Visions'. Mykonou steadfastly maintains that this stone exists. I think it's just a fairy tale. According to the legend, if you believe in it, the person who possesses this stone can look into the minds of people and read their thoughts. Supposedly, the crystal will grow in size and rotate and what not. The usual stories. Although, I must confess that it would nice to be able to read people's minds. Doesn't it ever occur to you how mysterious life really is? ^ ^ But I am digressing again, please excuse my philosophical inclinations. Mykonou is always telling me that our guild once had the stone. And then, one night long ago, an Equipment Maker stole it. Now they are experimenting with the stone in their dark cellars and are trying to find a way to use it. But there isn't any evidence for the stone's existence, let alone the theft. ^ ^ However, if you can find the stone and return it, I'd really be happy, that's for sure!"</line>
    <line id="13">"You need a lot of experience to do this work. If you like you can try and polish a stone yourself. Have a lot of fun with it, hee hee. But, as with everything else, you can only get good results by practicing. Fortunately you can learn a lot from teachers and trainers." {WORDtrainer}</line>
    <line id="14">"I don't think you'd like to become diamond polishers, since then you would have to settle down and stay here. If you'd like to learn something, then you can go to the Equipment Makers. They are specialists in fine locks. The problem is they don't always readily pass on their knowledge. I think Kemilo was an Equipment Maker originally. You can find him in our guild if he happens to be around. I believe he would show you if I asked him. He is extremely good with fine mechanisms. He makes locking mechanisms for all of our valuable chains." {WORDrequest}</line>
    <line id="15">"Yes, good, I'll let Kemilo know when I see him. He will certainly be able to teach you a few things."</line>
    <line id="16">"What's that? Isn't that... ^ ^ Where did you get that? It has to be a fake. That cannot be {FAT }the {NORS} Stone of the Thousand Visions! Where did you find it?{BLOK010} "We got it out of the equipment makers research centers. It was in a dust-covered chest."</line>
    <line id="17">"I don't believe it. If that's true, old Mykonou's stories were right. I still can't believe it. However, if that's really the stone, and it appears to be, then you must set it in the large ornament in the reception hall. Mykonou said that that's the only way the Stone can produce its effect. Why don't you try it out?"</line>

So, all attempts have been fairly unsuccessful up to now. Merdger still doesn't officially admit that the old traditions are pure superstition. But at least he does realize that he did something wrong and asks himself why. ^ ^ No one will succeed in spying on us. We are very careful about it now.

Pride is one of the spirit's weapons against fear. In the Artorn, you no longer need such a weapon since fear has already been fully conquered and the spirit no longer requires weapons.

And I say to you that these people speak for Animenkna who would like to keep magic for himself and not share it with his creatures, the Helromier. Whichever way it is, I will explain to you what magic is. When a house is built, the people who build it have a very exact idea of how this house is going to look. They have probably even made a plan ahead of time. And according to this plan, the house, which previously existed only on the plan, comes into reality. Do you believe me that the house would exist if enough beings concentrated on the fact that it does exist? Concentration is a poor word right now, but there is no better one. The house exists as soon as the Ens of a house is created. The healer can tell you what an Ens is. It is something like an idea. If you have an idea of something, and you have access to Animebona, the Entity, then you can create this Ens. And once you have done that, you can turn the Ens into matter.

    <line id="1">"Homer's songs are an accurate image of the war between the two poles Animebona and Animenkna. ^ ^ Especially the second part, which deals with the wanderings of Ulysses, is very instructive. For Ulysses incorporates the principle of Animenkna like no one else before his time. For him, adjusting to the flow of events is no longer important: he no longer feels himself to be a part of the flow of Animebona, which man had always felt up to then. For him adjusting to the flow is only superficial. He is like the boat which conquers the river because it superficially matches its movement, but he uses its abilities to conquer it for his own purposes. Purposes which belong to an entirely different world than the purpose of the flowing river. ^ ^ In this way, Ulysses hopes to escape the threat of the river." {WORDUlysses}{WORDAnimenkna}</line>
    <line id="2">"Just look at how he meets the dangers he is exposed to. ^ ^ He defeats the giant Polyphemus by calling himself 'No one'. In this way, he imitates his Ens, which chooses its name freely from its being. But the name Ulysses invents has nothing to do with his Ens, but with the purpose which it serves. He calls himself 'No one' and after 'No one' has served its purpose, he will remove it like a piece of clothing. ^ ^ He deceives the Sirens when he listens to their songs without falling victim to them. He does this by wrapping himself in chains. Chains, which are the principle of Animenkna, for Animebona lets everything flow freely. In this way, Ulysses can set himself above his companions, who have to row with their ears plugged. This is also new: a leader can gain knowledge which he MUST deny his followers so that all will survive. ^ ^ Force and order everywhere! The principle of Animenkna. And the climax is reached when Ulysses comes home." {WORDEns}{WORDarrival}</line>
    <line id="3">"When Ulysses comes home no one recognizes him, except for his dog and his nurse. The dog recognizes him by his Ens, the nurse recognizes him because she knew him in a former life, a life when Ulysses still swam with the flow and was bound by the principle of Animebona, where he received a scarred wound in battle with a wild boar. The new Ulysses would outsmart the boar and not get wounded. ^ ^ He outsmarts his wife's suitor by concealing his true identity and turning himself into a beggar. Bathrig later used this same self-denigration, and he always said that whoever denigrates himself will be raised at the end. In any case, Ulysses' untrustworthy wife recognizes him only when he pulls the bow which can be pulled by no one but Ulysses. And here, for the first time, Ulysses consciously returns to his own Ens and subjects himself to it for his own purpose - the purpose of protecting his family and retaining his lordship. He succeeds in doing this so convincingly that, before long, everyone is emulating his image. They did not even notice that they lost their freedom. In the end they all became the 'No one' who conquered the giant." {WORDBathrig}</line>

And he, Animenkna, said to her in the evening: you have created men, plants, the animal. Let the first guide the last, sister, and order the things and praise to you. Animebona said to her brother: they are my thoughts, which you seek to name and order. Are you guided by the fear that you do not know the One above All? He, Animenkna, left offended. And he swept through the forests, mountains, and sea. He gave order to the beings, and forgot none. He brought fire to men and iron for war. Then he, Animenkna, called the people. He called one Helromier and the other Celt, and he remained with the first. He named Sa-Ethar the leader of Helromia and directed him to endless battle, a battle against the children of the flow, the Celts. Order with fire, power with order. Cingetorix arose and also his brother the Catuvellaunus. But Sa-Ethar marched to battle, for being or dying, girded with Broto - his sword and his son. They came together in early morning and fought through the day and night. Then Vercingetorix fell early in the evening and Catuvellaunus in the same place. In dying he spoke, the Catuvellaunus: "Cursed be your sword, your Broto, your spirit, Sa-Ethar. Your sting will soon betray you. And murder will become the order which only promises power!" Then the Catuvellaunus died. And Sa-Ethar soon followed him into death, murdered by Broto, the false son. The sword brought death to the hand that ordered it. But the sting was soon pulled. The sons of the opponents grew up - Canto the sleeper and Bathrig, Helromier - like Ulysses - adapted to the essence. He seemed a servant of Animebona, the words flowed like waves. But this flow was poisoned with cunning: the source lay in the realm of Animenkna. The Celts, wearied from battle, drank. And fell to the name manifold, which Bathrig had given to the god of all gods. The essence called, and Canto awoke. He had slept long and on distant paths, and he tried and rode Animenkna's bull. Animebona called, to save the Celts from Bathrig and his god Iaghvir. Animebona saw the last of the few Celts assembled around Canto. Her spirit was strong and longed for Albion, the land which Cantos imagined beyond the mists. Animebona led the Celts along stone-less paths, without dark and light. Until one day in Cantos' spirit the white land broke through the fog. The white land, said Animebona, consists of all colors together. You cannot break it, for this is Albion: Go, and enlighten yourself."</line>

But their writing soon began to no longer just mean what it said. For them, the writing WAS what it said and their words WERE what they meant. The flow of the language froze and they began to stack individual concepts one onto the other like stones. Their language lost its spirit. They were still very clever, but without spirit.

But he lost his life by his own weapon, Broto, after he had killed Catuvellaunus and Vercingetorix." {WORDBroto}</line>
    <line id="11">"He was the son of Saethar, but much more clever than the latter, because he did not conquer the Celts through war, in which they were difficult to beat. Rather he enticed them by preaching the Unknown God to them. Unfortunately, this was very enticing for many of the Celts. They did not recognize that by preaching the Unknown God, Bathrig gave him a name - as is the nature of the Helromier. Canto discovered his true nature and, at the same time, saw that the earth was lost to the Helromier. He with the last faithful ones to Albion, a place where the Helromier did not yet have access. Their tower of words was not yet high enough. Now it appears to be..."</line>
    <line id="12">"It's typical that you, a Helromier, would ask about that. He is unknown; therefore, there is nothing more to say about him."</line>
    <line id="13">"Since magic has no words, it is difficult to explain. Imagine that you are with friends and all of you had a vivid concept of an event. This event will happen when you have the right access to Animebona. For Helromier, it is very difficult to grasp. But who knows? Perhaps Drannagh, our magic teacher, can help you. Have him explain to you precisely how our transport caves work!" {WORDtransport caves}</line>
    <line id="14">"Our bard, Mairi, is a treasure for our Order. You really should listen to her."</line>
    <line id="15">"Canto, who traveled far through the lands of Helromia, told us of the songs of Homer, of the war of the Iliad, where Achilles and Patrokles fell, and of the travels of Ulysses, who was the first to win against the magic of Animebona by freezing words and using them for his purposes. He was the first prince of Animenkna." {WORDUlysses}</line>
    <line id="16">"He built the tower of words. Where Ulysses laid the foundation, Aristotle devised the means to build the tower to great heights. He was a great thinker, there is no doubt about that. But he only used the goals of Animenkna. The Helromier value him as the founder of logic and, for them, that is the highest thing. But even through their logic, the Helromier have still not been able to understand the essence of magic. They may be stronger than the Celts, but they are still far from being everything!"</line>
    <line id="17">"Broto means sting. He was the sting of Saethar and, at the same time, his fate. There is an old saying that the Helromier will be destroyed by their own weapons some day, but I prefer to believe that they will be robbed of their superiority through their weapons. It goes against the spirit of Animebona for Animenkna to disappear completely. For the river exists only when there is a mountain AND a valley." </line>
    <line id="18">"The cunning Ulysses. A very interesting figure, even if we don't have much sympathy for him. His cleverness consisted of clinging to the magic of Animebona and then betraying it for his own purposes. As such, he was a great example for Bathrig. Consider the one-eyed giant Polyphemus. Ulysses saved himself by changing his name, thus using it as a tool for his purposes. He only imitated the magic which creates a name: for his name was no longer the expression of magic, but the expression of the purpose which he sought to accomplish. And this is probably one of the main differences between the Celts and the Helromier. Irkith is particularly brilliant in this area. You should ask her about it."</line>
    <line id="19">"She views things and living beings as individuals which do not belong to an order or higher state of being. You know, everything has its own magic - its own Ens. Therefore, a man does not become a man because he externally appears as a man, but he simply IS a man. Therefore, we call the counterpart of the entity - her brother Animenkna - the ontic, because he classifies everything and brings order to that which he sees as chaos when it is really nothing more than the variety of all Ens. To explain it simply: a man who feels like an Iskai IS an Iskai. Animenkna would never understand this. For him, this Iskai would be a man because he looks like one." {WORDEns}</line>
    <line id="20">"We are an order of beings who have reached a certain degree of understanding into the thoughts of Animebona. We are no longer human or Iskai, although we used to be one of the two, we are only the Enlightened Ones. Our Ens is enlightened. However, we are not a solid group, but are only loosely assembled here. For outsiders, this may appear to be a little chaotic; however, in reality, our Ens lead us here when we are needed. We also recognize each other by our Ens." {WORDEns}</line>
    <line id="21">"I will try to make this clear to you. That which brings you to speak of 'I' and, thus to mean something which differentiates you from others, is the Ens. But the Ens is more than that. The Ens is everything you are. If you try to describe it in words you will fail, because words are fixed concepts for you. They don't flow. Perhaps you should ask our healer." {WORDHelromier}</line>
    <line id="22">"Naturally, Drannagh knows more about that. But this much I can tell you: it's a really good thing. You can use it to travel to any place in Albion in a split second. It is our strongest magic." {WORDmagic}</line>
    <line id="23">"Just as the river does not flow evenly, so does the energy of Animebona not flow evenly. And so just as flowers sprout in the river when the current is particularly strong, so do flowers sprout in those places in which the spirit of Animebona is particularly strong. You too can feel the effect of the flow, the soul, when you enter such a place. You need only stay perfectly still at one of these points and meditate for a long time."</line>
    <line id="24">"No, we don't feel good about using the methods of Animenkna to save Animebona. But perhaps all of history has shown us that the two siblings were never completely separate. Aren't there remnants of Animebona on your planet? Can you really explain everything? I do not believe that you can do so. And ancient lore helps all of us in this perplexing situation. Because just as Saethar was slain by his own weapon, Broto, so also will the Toronto be destroyed through the assistance of Animenkna." {WORDToronto}</line>
    <line id="25">"It is the essence of Animenkna to put all knowledge in order and to thus stop any flow. But try to stop a river. No matter how strong and high a dam is, at some point even the smallest river will overcome and fill the basin. And so with the Toronto, Animenkna will celebrate only a passing success. At some point, Animebona will destroy this also - even if we should fail. For nothing that Animenkna orders lasts forever. Nevertheless we must try to destroy the Toronto for those who live and for those who come after us."</line>
    <line id="26">"Now it shall happen. The fact that you, Helromier, are going to destroy the Toronto is a good sign. For it could mean that Animenkna stands on our side. We may not understand Animenkna well enough. Maybe the Toronto is colliding with its own principles. Who knows? It's all in the flow." {WORDToronto}</line>

    <line id="9">"Oh, it's the most exciting time in my life! So much new knowledge! Once you have accepted a few new things, it is quite fun to change your world view. ^ ^ It so happens that there is some common ground because of the influence of ancient Greek knowledge. Cantos, who led his people here, was a highly educated man for his time. He had a great deal of knowledge of Roman and Greek culture. Although he fled their culture, he apparently did not scorn their knowledge. ^ ^ That is why many Greek legends and philosophers are cited here."</line>
    <line id="10">"Maybe migration is the wrong term. Actually, the Celts did not really leave their world, at least, not these Celts here. The ones who had to leave their world were the Celts who were subjected to the Roman conquest and the Christianization by St. Patrick, the Bathrig of the sagas here. The Celts here only wandered further into the world of Animebona, and at some time during this wandering they ended up here. ^ I still do not know how they were physically capable of doing such a thing, but I am sure that none of Animebona's beings have any questions about the physical difficulties. They don't think - physically, as opposed to us Helromier. In this case 'Hel' probably stands for Hellenes. ^ Christianization started with the Greek bible. And the Greek philosophers' influence on Christian teachings cannot be underestimated. There is a certain irony that religion, something which is completely irrational to us, is a threat to these people because it is TOO rational..."</line>
    <line id="11">"Good question! I still don't fully understand it myself. How can you explain something in rational terms, when it does not even relate to these terms? Nevertheless, I'll try to explain at least the mode of operation to you. ^ ^ Basically, it goes like this: whatever is thought in this world, and thought strongly enough, becomes matter. Perhaps it has something to do with the law of the preservation of energy. Perhaps the inhabitants of Albion have actually discovered a way to create matter out of the energy of their thoughts. ^ ^ In any case, the way it works is astounding. And because the beings here lack any categorical thinking, which is a feature of the terran Animenkna, anything can exist here. Not just things which have already existed. This does have its dark sides, because strong fear can also turn into matter. As a demon, for example." {BLOK010}"Do you have an explanation of Animenkna and Animebona for a rationalist such as me?"</line>
    <line id="12">"To be honest, I don't exactly know its effect. I have contributed my knowledge of science towards the creation of a deterrent against the Toronto, but my knowledge of magic is not yet profound enough for me to be able to understand everything. ^ ^ I'm sure that this seed is going to be the most powerful magic artifact that Albion has ever seen."</line>
    <line id="13">"Hello, friends! I'm really crossing my fingers for your mission against the Toronto. I hope you have soon finished with your preparations."{BLOK010}"Do you have any more tips for us?"{BLOK011}"Well, it's time for us to get going."</line>
    <line id="14">"Unfortunately, nothing specific. If only someone knew exactly how the seed worked! But the principles which created the seed are so diverse! I'm sure its power will develop near a large energy source, and the fusion reactor onboard the Toronto is the most powerful energy source on this world. Just to reassure you: I don't believe there will be a destructive reaction."</line>
    <line id="15">"It's funny. You see, I believe that at least some Dji Cantos see this mythology more as a philosophy, rather than as a religion. Don't tell my suspicions to anyone here. No-one talks about this subject. ^ ^ In any case, Animebona relates to thinking without categories, something which we Animenknists cannot imagine. If you are talking about a tree, then you mean any kind of tree. You're abstracting. And the Dji Cantos cannot - no, they will not do this kind of abstracting. It is inconceivable for them to throw all types of trees together. ^ ^ If I remember correctly, my history teacher taught us that for nature worshipers, every tree, every bush, and every animal could be a god. I'm sure this has something to do with it. ^ ^ Well, anyhow, here each being is seen as an INDIVIDUAL, although this term is not right since it comes from us Helromier. Each being originates as a separate thought of Animebona. And what magic does here is to generate a thought of Animebona. What the Dji Cantos think when they perform magic IS a thought of Animebona. ^ ^ Is that enough for a start? I'm sorry if I can't give you any more specific information."</line>

    <line id="13">"Oh, dear. Well, I've never been particularly interested in history, but let's see what I can remember. ^ ^ At one time, the Celts were in control of western Europe. I believe their cultural history began around 3000 BC when they split off from the Indo-European people. ^ They spread out in several waves of migration over the middle and the western parts of Europe. Their heyday ended around 50 BC with Caesar's conquests. In spite of this incident, and the later christianization at around 400 AD, many Celtic people preserved their culture for a long time. Their influence on the European culture can still be noticed today. ^ ^ The Druids are probably the best known Celtic figures. It is assumed they were priests of the nature-oriented religion, teachers, judges, and healers. Many Celtic heroic sagas form the foundation of the most famous European sagas. The Arthurian saga, for example, goes back to the Celts."</line>

    <line id="8">"My old teacher? He is excellent, I really recommend him. His specialty is critical hits. What only very few know is that he still gives lessons.
